# Question Set 5 - Fundamentals of Visual Computing
### Question 1
What is a Catmull-Rom curve?

#### *[This question was from 17. Surfaces & Volumes]*
<hr>

### Question 2
What is a reference frame?

#### *[This question was from 9. 3D Transformations]*
<hr>

### Question 3
What determines the colour of light after it has reflected off a surface?

#### *[This question was from 2. Images & Colours]*
<hr>

### Question 4
Consider this perspective projection.<br>
A point $\begin{bmatrix}x & y & z\end{bmatrix}^T$ is observed, which projects to the point $\begin{bmatrix}u & v & w\end{bmatrix}^T$ on the window.<br>
The window is planar, parallel to the $x$-$y$ plane, a distance $w$ to the origin.<br>
Express $\begin{bmatrix}u & v & w\end{bmatrix}^T$ in terms of $x$, $y$, $z$ and $w$.
