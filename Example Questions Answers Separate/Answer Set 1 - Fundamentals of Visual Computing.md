# Answer Set 1 - Fundamentals of Visual Computing
#### Answer:
$z=re^{i\phi}$ where:
- $r$ is the radius (magnitude) of $z$
- $\phi$ is the argument (angle) equal to $\tan^{-1}{\frac{b}{a}}$

#### Answer:
For a constant $a$, if $g(x)=e^{-ia\omega}f(x)$, then
$$
\mathcal{F}[g](\omega)=\mathcal{F}[f](\omega-a)
$$

#### Answer:
$$
F[k,j]=\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{f[n,m]e^{-2\pi i(\frac{kn}{N}+\frac{jm}{M})}}\,\,\,\, \mathrm{for}\,j,k=0,1,\cdots,N-1 \,\mathrm{independently}
$$
The inverse follows the same pattern.

#### Answer:
When two of the three rotational axes becomme aligned, we lose one degree of freedom. This means we cannot rotate in all three directions.

#### Answer:
$I_s=k_s i_s\cos^{\alpha}\phi$
where:
- $I_s$ is the specular component of the reflected light intensity
- $k_s$ is the specular reflectivity (reflection ratio)
- $i_s$ is the specular component of the light source intensity
- $\phi$ is the angle beteen the viewing ray and the reflected ray
- $\alpha$ is the shininess coefficient.

#### Answer:
If $f(x)$ is a period function with period $2\pi$, the function can be represented using the Fourier Series:
$$
f(x)=\frac{a_0}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{a_n \cos{nx}}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{b_n \sin{nx}}
$$
