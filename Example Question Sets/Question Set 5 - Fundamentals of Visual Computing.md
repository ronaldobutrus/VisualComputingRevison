# Question Set 5 - Fundamentals of Visual Computing
### Question 1
How does forward mapping work?

#### Answer:
Map each texel $(u,v)$ to surface point $(x,y,z)$. Copy the colour at $(u,v)$ to $(x,y,z)$.

### Question 2
How do we rotate about an arbitrary point?

#### Answer:
Translate the centre of rotation to the origin, rotate about the origin then translate the centre of origin back.

### Question 3
What is meant by *hidden surface removal*?

#### Answer:
Not depicting those parts of a scene that are not visible.

### Question 4
What is a subdivision surface and what are the benefits of using subdivision surfaces?

#### Answer:
A subdivision surface is generated by repeatedly applying a subdivision operator onto the control polygon. These have guaranteed continuity and a flexible level of detail.

### Question 5
What is the Lambert's Law?

#### Answer:
The intensity of reflected light is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the incoming light and the surface normal.

### Question 6
What is Computer Graphics?

#### Answer:
Synthesising an image from a model (usually geometry, appearance and lighting properties of a scene).

### Question 7
What is convolution?

#### Answer:
A general filtering approach that supports arbitrary kernels.

### Question 8
For vectors $ 
\bold{x} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 & x_2 & \cdots & x_n \\
\end{bmatrix}^T$ and 
$ 
\bold{y} =
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 & y_2 & \cdots & y_n \\
\end{bmatrix}^T$ what is the cross product $\bold{x}\times\bold{y}$ and what does it represent geometrically?

#### Answer:
$
\bold{x}\times\bold{y}=\begin{bmatrix}
x_2 y_3 - x_3y_2 \\
x_3 y_1 - x_1y_3 \\
x_1 y_2 - x_2y_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$ represents the direction of the vector normal to the plane formed by vectors $\bold{x}$ and $\bold{y}$. The direction of this normal vector $\bold{x}\times\bold{y}$ is given by the right hand rule where the index and middle fingers point in the direction of $\bold{x}$ and $\bold{y}$ respectively and the thumb points in the direction of $\bold{x}\times\bold{y}$.

How many different configurations of corner values are there in 2D? (Marching Squares algorithm)

#### Answer:
$2^4=16$ different configurations.

### Question 10
In what scenario will a surface be forward-facing but should not be rendered?

#### Answer:
If an object is not convex, then one face can be behind another.

What do we use to reconstruct the original continuous signal from samples?

#### Answer:
Convolution.

### Question 12
For two Bezier curves defined by points $\bold{p}_i$ and $\bold{q}_i$, how do we achieve $C^0$ continuity?

#### Answer:
$\bold{p}(1)=\bold{q}(0)$<br>
$\bold{p}_3=\bold{q}_0$

### Question 15
What is parallel projection? For a point $p=\begin{bmatrix}p_1\\p_2\\p_3\\1\end{bmatrix}$ what is the associated matrix (in the world reference frame)?

#### Answer:
In parallel/orthographic projection, the light rays are parallel. In the world frame, just drop the $z$ coordinate.<br>
$$\bold{K}_{parallel}=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$
